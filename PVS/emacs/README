This is the new directory structure for the Emacs end of PVS.

/emacs-src:		All .el files for the PVS interface
/emacs-src/ilisp:	The PVS ILISP Code (based on ilisp-5.8)
/nemacs/[x]emacsNN:	.elc (byte compiled) files for [X]emacs version NN

There is a Makefile in each of the emacs byte compiled directories
for rebuilding the elc files.  This uses the Elisp file pvs-byte-compile.el

Major differences from PVS2.2 include:

	o No support for Emacs 18
	o No support for lisp images other than Allegro
	o Improved support for [X]Emacs 20
	o Heavier reliance on Emacs supplied libraries
	o Byte Compilation of all Elisp code
	o New logo and font locking in XEmacs
	o Lots of bug fixes
