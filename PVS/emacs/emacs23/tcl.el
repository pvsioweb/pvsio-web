;; BEFORE USE:
;;
;; If you plan to use the interface to the TclX help files, you must
;; set the variable tcl-help-directory-list to point to the topmost
;; directories containing the TclX help files.  Eg:
;;
;;   (setq tcl-help-directory-list '("/usr/local/lib/tclx/help"))
;;
;;; Commentary:

;; CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:
;; * tcl-proc-list can be used to customize a list of things that
;; "define" other things.  Eg in my project I put "defvar" in this
;; list.
;; * tcl-typeword-list is similar, but uses font-lock-type-face.
;; * tcl-keyword-list is a list of keywords.  I've generally used this
;; for flow-control words.  Eg I add "unwind_protect" to this list.
;; * tcl-type-alist can be used to minimally customize indentation
;; according to context.

;; KNOWN BUGS:
;; * In Tcl "#" is not always a comment character.  This can confuse
;;   tcl.el in certain circumstances.  For now the only workaround is
;;   to enclose offending hash characters in quotes or precede it with
;;   a backslash.  Note that using braces won't work -- quotes change
;;   the syntax class of characters between them, while braces do not.
;;   The electric-# mode helps alleviate this problem somewhat.
;; * indent-tcl-exp is untested.

;; TODO:
;; * make add-log-tcl-defun smarter.  should notice if we are in the
;;   middle of a defun, or between defuns.  should notice if point is
;;   on first line of defun (or maybe even in comments before defun).
;; * Allow continuation lines to be indented under the first argument
;;   of the preceeding line, like this:
;;      [list something \
;;            something-else]
;; * There is a request that indentation work like this:
;;        button .fred -label Fred \
;;                     -command {puts fred}
;; * Should have tcl-complete-symbol that queries the inferior process.
;; * Should have describe-symbol that works by sending the magic
;;   command to a tclX process.
;; * Need C-x C-e binding (tcl-eval-last-exp).
;; * Write indent-region function that is faster than indenting each
;;   line individually.
;; * tcl-figure-type should stop at "beginning of line" (only ws
;;   before point, and no "\" on previous line).  (see tcl-real-command-p).
;; * overrides some comint keybindings; fix.
;; * Trailing \ will eat blank lines.  Should deal with this.
;;   (this would help catch some potential bugs).
;; * Inferior should display in half the screen, not the whole screen.
;; * Indentation should deal with "switch".
;; * Consider writing code to find help files automatically (for
;;   common cases).
;; * `#' shouldn't insert `\#' when point is in string.

  "*The current inferior-tcl process buffer.

MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT
===========================================================================
To run multiple Tcl processes, you start the first up with
\\[inferior-tcl].  It will be in a buffer named `*inferior-tcl*'.
Rename this buffer with \\[rename-buffer].  You may now start up a new
process with another \\[inferior-tcl].  It will be in a new buffer,
named `*inferior-tcl*'.  You can switch between the different process
buffers with \\[switch-to-buffer].

Commands that send text from source buffers to Tcl processes -- like
`tcl-eval-defun' or `tcl-load-file' -- have to choose a process to
send to, when you have more than one Tcl process around.  This is
determined by the global variable `inferior-tcl-buffer'.  Suppose you
have three inferior Lisps running:
    Buffer              Process
    foo                 inferior-tcl
    bar                 inferior-tcl<2>
    *inferior-tcl*      inferior-tcl<3>
If you do a \\[tcl-eval-defun] command on some Lisp source code, what
process do you send it to?

- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *inferior-tcl*), 
  you send it to that process.
- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you
  send it to the process attached to buffer `inferior-tcl-buffer'.
This process selection is performed by function `inferior-tcl-proc'.

Whenever \\[inferior-tcl] fires up a new process, it resets
`inferior-tcl-buffer' to be the new process's buffer.  If you only run
one process, this does the right thing.  If you run multiple
processes, you can change `inferior-tcl-buffer' to another process
buffer with \\[set-variable].")

  "Major mode for editing Tcl code.
Expression and list commands understand all Tcl brackets.
Tab indents for Tcl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Variables controlling indentation style:
  tcl-indent-level
    Indentation of Tcl statements within surrounding block.
  tcl-continued-indent-level
    Indentation of continuation line relative to first line of command.

Variables controlling user interaction with mode (see variable
documentation for details):
  tcl-tab-always-indent
    Controls action of TAB key.
  tcl-auto-newline
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces, brackets,
    and semicolons inserted in Tcl code.
  tcl-electric-hash-style
    Controls action of `#' key.
  tcl-use-hairy-comment-detector
    If t, use more complicated, but slower, comment detector.
    This variable is only used in Emacs 19.
  tcl-use-smart-word-finder
    If not nil, use a smarter, Tcl-specific way to find the current
    word when looking up help on a Tcl command.

Turning on Tcl mode calls the value of the variable `tcl-mode-hook'
