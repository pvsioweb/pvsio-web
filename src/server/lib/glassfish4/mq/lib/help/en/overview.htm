<P> You use the controls in the administration console to communicate with one 
  or more Message Queue brokers and object stores..</P>
<P>The administration console is divided into five panes, as shown below.</P>
<P><img src="../images/console.gif" alt="Diagram of the administration console separated into five zones."></P>
<UL>
<LI>1 - menu bar
<LI>2 - tool bar
<LI>3 - navigational pane
<LI>4 - results pane
<LI>5 - status pane
</UL>
<P>You use menus in the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> or icons in the <b>tool bar</b>
  to act upon elements selected in the <b>navigational pane</b> and the <b>results pane</b>.
  
  The <b>status 
  pane</b> displays information about the most recently completed action.</P>
<P>The navigational pane displays a tree view of the object stores and brokers 
  to which you are connected. Object stores contain administered objects, which 
  may be destinations (queue or topic) or connection factories. Brokers contain 
  an array of services and physical destinations.</P>
<ul>
  <li>To view destinations in an object store, click the Destinations folder. 
    Its contents are displayed in the results pane.</li>
  <li>To view information about connection factories in an object store, click 
    on the Connection Factories folder. The lookup name and type of each connection 
    factory is displayed in the results pane.</li>
  <li>To view information about services available on a broker, click the Services 
    folder. A list of services, each service's port number, and state is displayed 
    in the results pane.</li>
  <li>To view/change information about a particular service, select the service 
    in the results pane and choose <b>Actions &gt; Properties.</b></li>
  <li>To view information about physical destinations on a broker, click the Destinations 
    folder. A list of the destinations that have been created on that broker are 
    displayed, along with the destination's type and, for a queue, its delivery 
    policy. </li>
  <li>To view/change information about a particular destination, select the destination 
    in the results pane and choose <b>Actions &gt; Properties.</b></li>
</ul>
<P>In order to change the properties of an object store or of a broker, you must 
  first disconnect.</P>
<P>The administrative console gives you access to the basic functions of Message Queue administration 
  via a graphical interface. However, there are many more functions that are available 
  to you by using the appropriate Message Queue command utility. For more information, see 
  the<i> Message Queue Administrator's Guide</i>.</P>
