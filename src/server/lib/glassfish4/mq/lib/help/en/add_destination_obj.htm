  of a physical destination (a queue or a topic) in a broker. </P>

<P><b>Lookup Name</b> Use this field to specify the JNDI lookup name of the administered

  object is read only, client applications will not be able to modify administered 
  object attributes through api calls. </P>

<P><b>Destination Name</b> Use this field to specify the name of the physical 
  destination on the broker to which this administered object corresponds. If 
  you do not specify a name, the default name of <code>Untitled_Destination_Object</code>

<P><b>Destination Description</b> Use this field to enter a useful description
  of this destination object.</P>
