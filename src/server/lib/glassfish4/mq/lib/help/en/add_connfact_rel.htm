 <H2>Add Connection Factory Object &gt; <BR>
  Reliability and Flow Control</H2>
 
<P>Use this tab to specify the use of Message Queue control messages (broker acknowledgements) 
  and flow control measures by the client runtime..</P>

<p><b>Message Service Acknowledgement of Produced Messages</b> Specifies broker 
  acnowledgement of messages from producing client:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If set to true, the broker acknowledges receipt of all JMS messages (persistent 
    and non-persistent) from producing client, and producing client thread will 
    block waiting for those acknowledgements.</li>
  <li>If set to false, broker does not acknowledge receipt of any JMS message 
    (persistent or non-persistent) from producing client, and producing client 
    thread will not block waiting for broker acknowledgements.</li>
  <li> If not specified, broker acknowledges receipt of persistent messages only, 
    and producing client thread will block waiting for those acknowledgements.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Message Service Acknowledgement of Client Acknowledgements </b>Specifies 
  broker acnowledgement of consuming client acknowledements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If set to true, broker acknowledges all consuming client acknowledgements, 
    and consuming client thread will block waiting for such broker acknowledgements.</li>
  <li>If set to false, broker does not acknowledge any consuming client acknowledgements, 
    and consuming client thread will not block waiting for such broker acknowledgements.</li>
  <li> If not specified, broker acknowledges consuming client acknowledgements 
    for AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE and CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode (and consuming client thread 
    will block waiting for such broker acknowledgements), but does not acknowledge 
    consuming client acknowledgements for DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE mode (and consuming 
    client thread will not block.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Message Service Acknowledgement Timeout (milliseconds) </b>Specifies the 
  maximum time in milliseconds that the client runtime will wait for any broker 
  acknowledgement before throwing an exception. The default value of 0 means that 
  there is no timeout - in other words, the client runtime will wait forever.</p>
<p><b>Connection Flow Count </b> Specifies the maximum number of JMS messages 
  in a metered batch. When this number of JMS messages is delivered to the client 
  runtime, delivery is temporarily suspended, allowing any control messages that 
  had been held up to be delivered. JMS message delivery is resumed upon notification 
  by the client runtime, and continues until the count is again reached. If the 
  count is set to 0 then there is no restriction in the number of JMS messages 
  in a metered batch. A non-zero setting allows the client runtime to meter message 
  flow so that Message Queue control messages are not blocked by heavy JMS message delivery 
  and are allowed to flow to the client between metered batches.</p>
<p><b>Connection Flow Limit Enabled</b> Specifies whether to enable a connection 
  flow limit (on the number of unconsumed messages delivered to the client runtime). 
  If this box is checked, you must specify a positive number for the <b>Connection 
  Flow Limit </b>field.</p>
<p><b>Connection Flow Limit (Unconsumed Messages per Connection) </b>Specifies 
  a limit on the number of messages that can be delivered over a connection and 
  buffered in the client runtime, waiting to be consumed (only used if <b>Connection 
  Flow Limits Enabled </b>is checked). When the number of JMS messages delivered 
  to the client runtime (in accordance with the flow metering governed by <b>Connection 
  Flow Count</b>) exceeds this limit, message delivery stops. It is resumed only 
  when the number of unconsumed messages drops below the value set with this property. 
  This limit prevents a consuming client that is taking a long time to process 
  messages from being overwhelmed with pending messages that might cause it to 
  run out of memory. </p>
<p><b>Consumer Flow Limit (Unconsumed Messages per Consumer) </b>Specifies a limit 
  on the number of messages per consumer that can be delivered over a connection 
  and buffered in the client runtime. This limit has two uses: it can improve 
  load-balancing among consumers in multi-consumer queue delivery situations (no 
  one consumer can be sent a disproportionate number of messages), and it helps 
  prevent any one consumer on a connection from overwhelming other consumers on 
  the connection. When the number of JMS messages delivered to the client runtime 
  exceeds this limit for any consumer, message delivery for that consumer stops. 
  It is resumed only when the number of unconsumed messages for that consumer 
  drops below the value set with the <b>Consumer Flow Threshold</b>. </p>
<p>Note that if the total number of messages buffered for all consumers on a connection 
  exceeds the <b>Connection Flow Limit</b>, then delivery of messages through 
  the connection will stop until that total drops below that limit. If you specify 
  a Consumer Flow Limit, there is little need to set Connection Flow Limit except 
  in the most specialized of cases and most application requirements for message 
  flow metering will be met by setting Consumer Flow Limit instead of enabling 
  the Connection Flow Limit.</p>
<P><b>Consumer Flow Threshold (Percent) </b>Specifies, as a percentage of <b>Consumer 
  Flow Limit</b>, the number of messages per consumer buffered in the client runtime, 
  below which delivery of messages for a consumer will resume. </P>
